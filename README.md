# Optimization Project
Focus topic of our project are **Min-Max Problems**. Min-max or saddle point problems are more difficult problems than minimization problems. Meanwhile, min-max problems often arise in machine learning. The goal of this project is to understand the difference between min-max problems and minimization problems, and to learn methods for min-max problems. In pursuit of this goal we work with two papers: [**A Variational Inequality Perspective on Generative Adversarial Networks**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1laEnA5Ym) and [**On the Convergence of Single-Cell Stochastic Extra-Gradient Methods**](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/4625d8e31dad7d1c4c83399a6eb62f0c-Paper.pdf). We analyze those papers, pick apart their methods, compare them to previous work in the field and evaluate their experiments. In the end of the project we hope to have learnt several useful approaches for dealing with the min-max problem.
